~~And maybe a sample side project that I'll probably never finish...~~

This project uses OpenJDK 11.

## Kafka Basics

---

### Environment Setup

To execute the code for Producers and Consumers inside `kafka-basics/`, it is necessary to have an instance of Zookeeper, at `localhost:2181`, and Kafka running in your localhost at port `localhost:9092`.

### Docker Containers

Environment setup is already configured in the `docker-compose.yml` dockerfile.

Inside the project's folder, run:

```console
docker compose up
```

This will pull the images from Docker Hub and start the required services.

---

### Topics

A topic called `demo.java.topic` should also be created with at least 3 partitions. This allows to observe the logs and see Kafka's behavior to assign, manage and rebalance partitions.

Scripts to execute the commands below are available in the `bin/` folder of the Apache Kafka [Binary Download](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads)

#### Create Topics

```console
kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic demo.java.topic --create --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
```

#### List Topics

```console
kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
```

#### Describe Topics

```console
kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --topic demo.java.topic
```

#### Delete Topics

```console
kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --delete --topic demo.java.topic
```

There are also ways to start Producers and Consumers from the CLI tools.
